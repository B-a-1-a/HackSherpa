# HackSherpa

## Inspiration
HackSherpa was created to simplify hackathon challenges. We noticed that teams often struggled with generating ideas, choosing the right tech stack, and creating compelling presentations. Our goal was to create a tool that streamlines this entire process, allowing participants to focus on innovation rather than logistics.

## What it does
HackSherpa is a comprehensive hackathon assistant designed to guide teams from ideation to presentation. It offers:

- **Project Idea Assistant**: By scraping data from DevPost, HackSherpa collects insights from past projects and uses them to generate fresh, innovative project ideas. It also recommends suitable tech stacks and checks if similar projects have succeeded in previous hackathons.
- **Readme and Presentation Generator**: Once a project idea is finalized, HackSherpa transforms it into polished documentation and slide decks using pre-defined templates and data-driven content generation. This ensures teams can present their work clearly and professionally.

HackSherpa is the result of a passionate collaboration in data scraping, intelligent data analysis, and thoughtful design — all aimed at empowering hackathon participants to succeed with confidence and clarity.

## How we built it
We approached the development of HackSherpa in three key phases:

1. **Data Scraping and Analysis**: We built a robust system to scrape project data from DevPost, gathering valuable insights from past hackathon projects. This data forms the foundation of our database.
2. **Project Idea Assistant**: Using intelligent data analysis, we extracted trends from the scraped data, enabling HackSherpa to suggest fresh project ideas, recommend suitable tech stacks, and cross-check the success of similar past projects.
3. **Readme and Presentation Generator**: We created a module that takes raw ideas and transforms them into structured, polished documentation and slide decks. By using pre-defined templates and data-driven content generation, this module ensures teams have high-quality, ready-to-present materials.
4. **Web Application Integration**: Finally, we integrated these components into a cohesive, user-friendly web application. This seamless interface makes it easy for teams to access all of HackSherpa’s features and navigate through the different phases of their hackathon journey.

## Challenges we ran into
- **Data Quality and Consistency**: Ensuring the scraped data from DevPost was clean and consistent required significant effort. We developed robust cleaning scripts and validation checks to maintain data integrity.
- **Idea Generation Algorithms**: Crafting meaningful and original project ideas from historical data required sophisticated analysis and creative algorithms.
- **Template Customization**: Balancing structured templates with flexibility for unique projects posed a design challenge, but we aimed to offer customizable options while maintaining consistency.

## Accomplishments that we're proud of
- Successfully built a fully integrated platform that streamlines the hackathon workflow.
- Created a data-driven Project Idea Assistant that generates innovative, tailored project suggestions.
- Developed polished, professional documentation and presentation generation tools that save teams hours of effort.
- Delivered a user-friendly web application with a clean, intuitive interface.

## What we learned
- **Advanced Data Scraping Techniques**: We honed our skills in web scraping, data cleaning, and building a structured database from dynamic web content.
- **Intelligent Data Analysis**: Analyzing historical data to identify trends and generate meaningful insights was a valuable learning experience.
- **Full-Stack Development**: Integrating a robust backend with a seamless frontend taught us the importance of maintaining both functionality and usability.
- **Collaboration and Design Thinking**: Bringing together different skills and perspectives allowed us to create a well-rounded, impactful product.

## What's next for HackSherpa
- **Enhanced AI-Powered Recommendations**: Implementing machine learning models to refine project idea suggestions and tech stack recommendations.
- **Expanded Data Sources**: Scraping from additional hackathon platforms to broaden our insights and improve recommendation diversity.
- **Real-Time Collaboration Tools**: Adding features like live editing for documentation and slide decks to foster teamwork.
- **Mentorship and Resource Integration**: Connecting teams with mentors and providing learning resources directly within the platform.
- **Mobile App Development**: Expanding accessibility through a mobile-friendly version of HackSherpa.

HackSherpa is just getting started — we’re excited to keep evolving and supporting hackathon participants around the world.
