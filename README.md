# Introduction to GitHub
==========================

## Project Title
Introduction to GitHub is a course designed to help new developers, GitHub users, and students get started with GitHub in under an hour.

## Description
This course covers the basics of GitHub, including repositories, branches, commits, and pull requests. By the end of this course, you will have created a short Markdown file that can be used as your profile README.

## Installation Instructions
To start this course, follow these steps:

1. Click the **Start course** button below to create a new repository.
2. In the new tab, most of the prompts will automatically fill in for you.
   - For owner, choose your personal account or an organization to host the repository.
   - We recommend creating a public repository, as private repositories will [use Actions minutes](https://docs.github.com/en/billing/managing-billing-for-github-actions/about-billing-for-github-actions).
   - Scroll down and click the **Create repository** button at the bottom of the form.
3. After your new repository is created, wait about 20 seconds, then refresh the page. Follow the step-by-step instructions in the new repository's README.
